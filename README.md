To install this project, you need Node.js to run it in the command line, and either GitBash or a ZIP extracter to download it. You also need Node Package Manager or similar to install the dependencies.

## Usage

To run this project, download it, either by cloning the repository or by downloading a ZIP of it and extracting it. Then use the command line to navigate to the folder it is in. First, type 'npm i' to install the dependencies, which might take a moment. Once that is done, type 'Node index.js' to run it.
